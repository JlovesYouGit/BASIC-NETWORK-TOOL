# Network Management Tool - Demonstration Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step demonstration of the Network Management Tool capabilities.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Required Python packages (from `requirements.txt`)
3. Nmap installed on your system
4. Network access to test devices

## Demo Scenario

In this demonstration, we'll show how to:
1. Scan a local network to discover devices
2. View detailed information about discovered devices
3. Securely manage a device on the network

## Step-by-Step Demo

### 1. Network Scanning

First, let's scan the local network to discover connected devices:

```bash
python network_tool.py --scan local
```

Expected output:
```
Discovered devices:
IP                   MAC
192.168.1.1          00:11:22:33:44:55
192.168.1.10         aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
192.168.1.15         11:22:33:44:55:66
```

### 2. Interactive Dashboard

Launch the interactive dashboard for a richer experience:

```bash
python network_tool.py --dashboard
```

In the dashboard:
1. Select "Scan local network"
2. View the table of discovered devices
3. Select a device to view detailed information

### 3. Device Management

Select a device to manage:

```bash
python network_tool.py --manage 192.168.1.10
```

When prompted, enter the appropriate credentials to access the device.

## Advanced Features

### Device Fingerprinting

The tool can gather detailed information about devices including:
- Operating system detection
- Open ports and running services
- Hostname information

### Security Features

- SSH key-based authentication
- Encrypted communication
- Secure credential handling
- Comprehensive logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied errors**: Run the tool with appropriate privileges
2. **Device not found**: Verify the IP range and network connectivity
3. **Authentication failures**: Check credentials and SSH configuration

### Logs

All operations are logged to `network_tool.log` for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

## Conclusion

This demonstration shows the core capabilities of the Network Management Tool. The tool provides a comprehensive solution for network discovery, device analysis, and secure management.
