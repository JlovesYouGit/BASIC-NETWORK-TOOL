# Network Management Tool - Architecture Overview

This document explains how the interconnected functions of the Network Management Tool align to create a comprehensive network management solution.

## System Architecture

The Network Management Tool follows a modular architecture with clearly defined components that work together to provide complete network management capabilities.

```
Network Management Tool
├── Main Application (network_tool.py)
├── Core Modules
│   ├── Scanner Module (scanner.py)
│   ├── Manager Module (manager.py)
│   └── Dashboard Module (dashboard.py)
├── Utilities (utils/)
└── Tests (tests/)
```

## Component Interactions

### 1. Main Application
The main application (`network_tool.py`) serves as the entry point and orchestrator for all functionality:

- Parses command-line arguments
- Initializes core modules
- Routes requests to appropriate components
- Handles global error management and logging

### 2. Scanner Module
The scanner module (`scanner.py`) provides network discovery capabilities:

- Discovers devices on local, server, and web networks
- Performs basic device identification (IP/MAC addresses)
- Integrates with Nmap for advanced device fingerprinting
- Returns structured device information for other modules

**Dependencies:**
- Scapy (for ARP scanning)
- Nmap/python-nmap (for advanced fingerprinting)

### 3. Manager Module
The manager module (`manager.py`) handles device management operations:

- Establishes secure SSH connections to devices
- Executes management commands (e.g., disabling network interfaces)
- Implements both password and key-based authentication
- Provides secure credential handling

**Dependencies:**
- Paramiko (for SSH connectivity)

### 4. Dashboard Module
The dashboard module (`dashboard.py`) provides an interactive user interface:

- Displays discovered devices in a rich, interactive table
- Allows users to select devices for detailed viewing
- Integrates with the scanner for device fingerprinting
- Coordinates with the manager for device operations

**Dependencies:**
- Rich (for interactive CLI interface)

## Data Flow

### Basic Scanning Workflow
1. User initiates scan via CLI arguments
2. Main application routes request to Scanner module
3. Scanner performs network discovery
4. Results are returned to main application
5. Main application displays results

### Interactive Dashboard Workflow
1. User launches dashboard
2. Dashboard initializes and displays menu
3. User selects scan option
4. Dashboard calls Scanner module
5. Scanner returns device list
6. Dashboard displays interactive table
7. User selects device for management
8. Dashboard calls Manager module
9. Manager performs requested operations

### Device Management Workflow
1. User selects device to manage
2. Dashboard/CLI collects credentials
3. Manager establishes SSH connection
4. Manager executes management commands
5. Results are reported to user

## Security Integration

All modules implement security best practices:

- Secure credential handling in Manager module
- Encrypted SSH connections
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Input validation and error handling

## Extensibility

The modular design allows for easy extension:

- New scanning techniques can be added to Scanner module
- Additional management capabilities can be added to Manager module
- Enhanced UI features can be added to Dashboard module
- New utility functions can be added to Utils package

## Testing Architecture

Each module has corresponding test files in the tests directory:

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Test coverage reports

## Deployment Considerations

The architecture supports various deployment scenarios:

- Standalone command-line tool
- Interactive dashboard application
- Integration with larger network management systems
- Containerized deployment (Docker support planned)

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture facilitates future enhancements:

- Web-based dashboard using Flask/Django
- Database integration for persistent storage
- REST API for remote access
- Advanced analytics and reporting
