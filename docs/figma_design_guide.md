# Figma Design Guide for Network Management Tool

This guide provides instructions on how to design the web interface for the Network Management Tool using Figma.

## What is Figma?

Figma is a collaborative web-based interface design tool that allows teams to create, prototype, and collaborate on user interface designs in real-time. It's particularly well-suited for web application design.

## Setting Up Figma

1. Go to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com)
2. Create a free account or sign in
3. Create a new file for the Network Management Tool

## Design Components

### 1. Dashboard View

Create a frame for the main dashboard with the following elements:

- **Navigation Bar**: 
  - Logo/Brand
  - Navigation links (Dashboard, Scan, History, Analytics, Settings)
  - User profile dropdown

- **Statistics Cards**:
  - Total Devices
  - Online Devices
  - Servers
  - Last Scan Time

- **Device List**:
  - Grid layout with device cards
  - Each card should show:
    - Device name/IP
    - Status indicator (online/offline)
    - OS information
    - Quick action buttons (Fingerprint, Manage)

### 2. Device Detail View

Create a frame for the device detail view with:

- **Device Information Panel**:
  - IP Address
  - MAC Address
  - Hostname
  - Operating System
  - Open Ports with Services

- **Action Buttons**:
  - Fingerprint Device
  - Manage Device
  - Refresh Information

### 3. Scan Controls

Create a frame for scan controls with:

- **Scan Type Selection**:
  - Local Network
  - Server Network
  - Web Server

- **Scan Parameters**:
  - IP Range input
  - Port selection
  - Scan intensity options

- **Action Buttons**:
  - Start Scan
  - Stop Scan
  - Save Results

### 4. Management Panel

Create a frame for device management with:

- **Authentication Form**:
  - Username input
  - Password input
  - SSH Key upload

- **Management Actions**:
  - Disable Network Interface
  - Reboot Device
  - Run Custom Command

## Design System

### Colors

- **Primary**: #0d6efd (Bootstrap Blue)
- **Success**: #28a745 (Green)
- **Warning**: #ffc107 (Yellow)
- **Danger**: #dc3545 (Red)
- **Background**: #f8f9fa (Light Gray)
- **Text**: #212529 (Dark Gray)

### Typography

- **Headings**: Bold, larger font sizes
- **Body Text**: Normal weight, readable size
- **Labels**: Smaller, muted color

### Spacing

- Use consistent padding and margins
- Apply the 8px grid system
- Maintain visual hierarchy

## Prototyping

### Interactions

1. **Navigation**: 
   - Clicking nav links should transition between views
   - Hover states for interactive elements

2. **Device Selection**:
   - Clicking a device card should open the detail view
   - Double-click for quick actions

3. **Scan Process**:
   - Start scan button should show loading state
   - Progress indicator during scan
   - Results display when complete

### Transitions

- Use smooth transitions between views
- Apply fade or slide animations for better UX
- Maintain context during navigation

## Exporting Assets

Figma allows you to export design assets:

1. **Icons**: Export SVG icons for development
2. **Images**: Export any custom graphics
3. **Style Guide**: Export color palettes and typography styles

## Collaboration Features

Figma's collaboration features are particularly useful:

- **Comments**: Leave feedback on specific design elements
- **Version History**: Track design changes over time
- **Component Libraries**: Create reusable UI components
- **Real-time Editing**: Multiple designers can work simultaneously

## Implementation Handoff

When the design is complete, use Figma's developer handoff features:

1. **Inspect Panel**: Developers can view CSS properties, dimensions, and assets
2. **Code Generation**: Figma can generate basic CSS and React code
3. **Asset Export**: Export all necessary assets for development

## Best Practices

1. **Mobile-First Design**: Start with mobile layouts and scale up
2. **Consistent Components**: Use the same components throughout the design
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient color contrast and readable typography
4. **User Testing**: Create prototypes and test with real users
5. **Documentation**: Document design decisions and component usage

## Getting Started Template

To get started quickly, you can:

1. Use Figma's UI kits as a starting point
2. Import Bootstrap or Material Design components
3. Create a design system library for consistency
4. Start with wireframes before moving to high-fidelity designs

## Next Steps

1. Create a Figma account
2. Design the main dashboard view
3. Create device card components
4. Design the device detail view
5. Add navigation and interaction prototypes
6. Share with stakeholders for feedback
7. Iterate based on feedback
8. Prepare for developer handoff

This guide provides a foundation for designing the Network Management Tool web interface in Figma. As you work on the design, remember to focus on usability, accessibility, and maintaining consistency throughout the interface.
