- Displaying discovered devices in a rich table
- Viewing detailed device information
- Device fingerprinting with visual feedback

### 3. Performance Metrics

The performance metrics view shows:
- Network latency over time chart
- Bandwidth usage chart
- Performance statistics

### 4. Device Management

The device management interface provides:
- Device selection and management
- Authentication method selection
- Progress indicators during management operations

## Implementation Details

### EnhancedTerminalDashboard Class

The main class that implements the enhanced terminal dashboard:

```python
class EnhancedTerminalDashboard:
    def __init__(self, scanner, manager):
        # Initialize with scanner and manager instances
    
    def run(self):
        # Main dashboard loop
    
    def _show_main_dashboard(self):
        # Display main dashboard menu
    
    def _show_network_overview(self):
        # Display network overview with charts
    
    def _show_device_discovery(self):
        # Display device discovery interface
    
    def _perform_scan(self, network_type):
        # Perform network scan and display results
    
    def _show_device_details(self, device):
        # Show detailed device information
    
    def _show_performance_metrics(self):
        # Display performance metrics with charts
    
    def _show_device_management(self):
        # Display device management interface
    
    def _manage_device(self, ip_address):
        # Manage a specific device
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Dashboard

```bash
python network_tool.py --enhanced-dashboard
```

### Navigation

1. Use the number keys to select options from the main menu
2. Press Enter to confirm selections
3. Use 'back' to return to previous menus
4. Press Ctrl+C to exit the dashboard

### Scanning Networks

1. Select "Device Discovery" from the main menu
2. Choose the network type to scan:
   - Local Network Scan
   - Server Network Scan
   - Web Server Scan
3. View scan results in a formatted table
4. Select a device for detailed information

### Viewing Device Details

1. After scanning, enter the ID of a device to view details
2. View comprehensive device information including:
   - IP and MAC addresses
   - Hostname
   - Operating system
   - Open ports and services
3. View open ports distribution chart

### Managing Devices

1. From the device details view, choose to manage the device
2. Select authentication method (password or SSH key)
3. Enter authentication credentials
4. View progress during management operations

## Visual Components

### ASCII Charts

The dashboard uses plotext to create ASCII charts:

```python
import plotext as plt

# Line chart
plt.plot(x_data, y_data)
plt.show()

# Bar chart
plt.bar(x_data, y_labels)
plt.show()
```

### Rich Components

The dashboard uses rich for enhanced terminal UI:

```python
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table
from rich.panel import Panel
from rich.progress import Progress
```

## Customization

### Adding New Dashboard Views

To add new dashboard views:

1. Create a new method in the EnhancedTerminalDashboard class
2. Add the view to the main dashboard menu
3. Implement the visualization logic using plotext and rich

### Modifying Charts

To modify charts:

1. Update the data generation logic
2. Modify the plotext chart configuration
3. Adjust the chart size and appearance

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the enhanced dashboard include:

1. **Real-time Data Updates**: Live updating charts and statistics
2. **Additional Chart Types**: More visualization options
3. **Customizable Layouts**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
4. **Export Functionality**: Export charts and data to files
5. **Alert System**: Visual alerts for network issues
6. **Multiple Network Views**: Simultaneous monitoring of multiple networks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chart Display Issues**: Ensure terminal supports ANSI escape sequences
2. **Performance**: Large datasets may slow down chart rendering
3. **Screen Clearing**: Some terminals may not clear properly

### Solutions

1. **Chart Display**: Set TERM environment variable:
   ```bash
   export TERM=xterm-256color
   ```

2. **Performance**: Limit dataset sizes for charting

3. **Screen Clearing**: Use terminals that support proper ANSI escape sequences

## Comparison to blessed-contrib

While blessed-contrib is a JavaScript library for Node.js, our Python implementation provides similar functionality:

| Feature | blessed-contrib (JavaScript) | Enhanced Dashboard (Python) |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Terminal Handling | blessed | blessed |
| Charting | drawille | plotext |
| UI Components | Built-in widgets | rich library |
| Platform Support | Cross-platform | Cross-platform |
| Installation | npm | pip |

## Conclusion

The enhanced terminal dashboard provides a rich, visual interface for network management directly in the terminal. Using Python libraries that provide similar functionality to blessed-contrib, it offers:

- Interactive menus and navigation
- ASCII charts and visualizations
- Progress indicators and feedback
- Device management capabilities
- Cross-platform compatibility

The dashboard enhances the user experience while maintaining the simplicity and accessibility of terminal-based applications.
