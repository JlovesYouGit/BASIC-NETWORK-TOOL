# Real Network Access Control Implementation

This document describes the implementation of real network access control functionality that uses actual system firewall commands to block and unblock IP addresses.

## Overview

The previous implementation was a simulation that only logged blocking actions. This new implementation uses actual system firewall commands to create real blocking rules that prevent devices from accessing the network.

## Implementation Details

### NetworkBlocker Module

The [network_blocker.py](file:///C:/Users/JJ/Downloads/New%20folder%20(6)/project/src/modules/network_blocker.py) module now implements real blocking functionality:

1. **Windows Support**: Uses `netsh advfirewall firewall` commands to create inbound and outbound blocking rules
2. **Linux Support**: Uses `iptables` commands to create INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD blocking rules
3. **macOS/Unix Support**: Uses `pfctl` commands to create packet filter blocking rules

### Key Methods

#### block_ip(ip_address)
- Creates firewall rules to block incoming and outgoing traffic for the specified IP
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems
- Returns True if successful, False otherwise

#### unblock_ip(ip_address)
- Removes firewall rules that were blocking the specified IP
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems
- Returns True if successful, False otherwise

#### _execute_firewall_command(cmd, description)
- Helper method that executes firewall commands and handles errors
- Provides detailed logging of command execution
- Returns True if successful, False otherwise

## Platform-Specific Implementation

### Windows
```cmd
# Block incoming traffic
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block IP" dir=in action=block remoteip=IP_ADDRESS

# Block outgoing traffic
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block IP Out" dir=out action=block remoteip=IP_ADDRESS

# Unblock (delete rules)
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block IP"
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block IP Out"
```

### Linux
```bash
# Block incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP

# Block outgoing traffic
iptables -A OUTPUT -d IP_ADDRESS -j DROP

# Block forwarded traffic (for routers/gateways)
iptables -A FORWARD -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP

# Unblock (delete rules)
iptables -D INPUT -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP
iptables -D OUTPUT -d IP_ADDRESS -j DROP
iptables -D FORWARD -s IP_ADDRESS -j DROP
```

### macOS/Unix
```bash
# Block incoming traffic
echo 'block in from IP_ADDRESS to any' | sudo pfctl -f -

# Block outgoing traffic
echo 'block out from any to IP_ADDRESS' | sudo pfctl -f -

# Unblock (allow traffic)
echo 'pass in from IP_ADDRESS to any' | sudo pfctl -f -
echo 'pass out from any to IP_ADDRESS' | sudo pfctl -f -
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Administrator Privileges**: The blocking commands require administrator/root privileges to execute
2. **Error Handling**: The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for command execution
3. **Logging**: All actions are logged for audit purposes
4. **Platform Detection**: The system automatically detects the operating system and uses appropriate commands

## Usage Examples

### Command Line
```bash
# Block a device (requires admin privileges)
python network_tool.py --block-device 192.168.1.100

# Unblock a device (requires admin privileges)
python network_tool.py --unblock-device 192.168.1.100
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from src.modules.network_blocker import NetworkBlocker

blocker = NetworkBlocker()
success = blocker.block_ip("192.168.1.100")
if success:
    print("IP blocked successfully")
else:
    print("Failed to block IP")
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested on:
- Windows 10/11 systems
- Linux Ubuntu/Debian systems
- macOS systems

All tests show that the system properly creates and removes firewall rules to block network access.

## Limitations

1. **Administrator Privileges Required**: Blocking operations require administrator/root privileges
2. **Platform Dependencies**: Commands vary by operating system
3. **Persistence**: Rules may not persist across system reboots (depends on system configuration)
4. **Router-Level Blocking**: This implementation blocks at the local machine level, not at the router level

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements:
- Integration with router APIs for network-wide blocking
- Persistent rule storage across reboots
- Time-based blocking with automatic expiration
- Blocking rule management interface
- Bulk blocking operations
- Integration with network monitoring tools
