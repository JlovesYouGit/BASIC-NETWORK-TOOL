# Network Access Control Summary

This document describes the new network access control capabilities added to the Network Management Tool, which allow you to block and unblock devices from accessing your network.

## Overview

The new network access control features provide a more effective way to deal with problematic devices by completely blocking their network access rather than just flagging them. This is accomplished through firewall rule management that prevents the devices from communicating on the network.

## New Methods

### DeviceManager.block_device_network_access()
- **Purpose**: Blocks a device's network access by adding it to a firewall block list
- **Parameters**: 
  - `ip_address` (str): The IP address of the device to block
  - `network_gateway` (str): The network gateway IP address (default: "192.168.1.1")
- **Returns**: Boolean indicating success or failure
- **Location**: `src/modules/manager.py`

### DeviceManager.unblock_device_network_access()
- **Purpose**: Unblocks a device's network access by removing it from a firewall block list
- **Parameters**: 
  - `ip_address` (str): The IP address of the device to unblock
  - `network_gateway` (str): The network gateway IP address (default: "192.168.1.1")
- **Returns**: Boolean indicating success or failure
- **Location**: `src/modules/manager.py`

### EnhancedTerminalDashboard._block_device_access()
- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive interface for blocking device network access
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None (interactive interface)
- **Location**: `src/modules/enhanced_dashboard.py`

### EnhancedTerminalDashboard._unblock_device_access()
- **Purpose**: Provides an interactive interface for unblocking device network access
- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: None (interactive interface)
- **Location**: `src/modules/enhanced_dashboard.py`

## Command-Line Usage

### Block a Device
```bash
python network_tool.py --block-device 192.168.1.100
```

### Unblock a Device
```bash
python network_tool.py --unblock-device 192.168.1.100
```

## Enhanced Dashboard Usage

The enhanced terminal dashboard now includes two new menu options:
1. Block Device Access - Blocks a device's network access
2. Unblock Device Access - Restores a device's network access

## Implementation Details

The blocking mechanism works by:
1. Connecting to the network gateway/firewall
2. Adding iptables rules or similar firewall rules to block the device's IP
3. In a real implementation, this would interact with actual network equipment
4. In this demonstration, it simulates the process with appropriate feedback

## Security Considerations

- The blocking mechanism is more effective than simple flagging as it actively prevents network communication
- Access to blocking/unblocking features should be restricted to authorized personnel
- Logs are generated for all blocking/unblocking actions for audit purposes
- The system provides clear feedback on the success or failure of blocking operations

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the network access control features:
- Integration with actual firewall APIs (iptables, pfSense, etc.)
- Time-based blocking with automatic expiration
- Blocking based on MAC address in addition to IP
- Integration with network switches for port-based blocking
- Bulk blocking operations for multiple devices
- Blocking rule persistence across reboots
