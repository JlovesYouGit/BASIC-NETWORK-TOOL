## Nmap Integration Status

✅ **Fully Functional** with multiple fallback mechanisms:

1. **Primary**: python-nmap library integration
2. **Secondary**: Explicit path to Nmap executable in break folder
3. **Fallback**: Basic scanning methods when Nmap is unavailable

Nmap version 7.98 is installed in the break folder and accessible to the application.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Show help
python run.py --help

# Scan local network
python run.py --scan local

# Scan server network
python run.py --scan server

# Scan web server
python run.py --scan web

# Manage a specific device
python run.py --manage 192.168.1.100

# Launch interactive dashboard
python run.py --dashboard
```

## Installation and Setup

1. **Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Nmap Setup**:
   - Run `setup_nmap.bat` to add Nmap to your PATH
   - Or use the built-in fallback to the break folder

3. **SSH Key Setup** (for secure authentication):
   - Generate SSH keys: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
   - Copy public key to target devices: `ssh-copy-id user@host`

## Documentation
