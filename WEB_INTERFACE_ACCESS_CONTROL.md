# Web Interface Network Access Control Enhancement

This document describes the enhancements made to the Network Management Tool's web interface to include network access control features for blocking and unblocking devices.

## Overview

The web interface has been enhanced with new functionality to allow users to block and unblock devices directly from the dashboard, providing a more intuitive way to manage network access without using command-line tools.

## New Features Added

### 1. Block Device Access
- **Purpose**: Prevent a device from accessing the network
- **Location**: Device cards in the dashboard show a "Block" button
- **Implementation**: 
  - Clicking "Block" opens a confirmation modal
  - Confirmed blocking sends a POST request to `/api/device/<ip>/block`
  - Backend uses the DeviceManager's block_device_network_access method

### 2. Unblock Device Access
- **Purpose**: Restore a device's network access
- **Location**: Device cards for blocked devices show an "Unblock" button
- **Implementation**: 
  - Clicking "Unblock" opens a confirmation modal
  - Confirmed unblocking sends a POST request to `/api/device/<ip>/unblock`
  - Backend uses the DeviceManager's unblock_device_network_access method

### 3. Visual Indicators
- **Purpose**: Clearly show which devices are blocked
- **Implementation**: 
  - Blocked devices are highlighted with a red border
  - A "BLOCKED" badge is displayed on blocked device cards
  - Device cards dynamically update to show the correct action button

## API Endpoints Added

### POST /api/device/<ip>/block
- **Purpose**: Block a device's network access
- **Request**: None (IP in URL)
- **Response**: JSON with status and message
- **Location**: `src/web/app.py` and `src/web/api.py`

### POST /api/device/<ip>/unblock
- **Purpose**: Unblock a device's network access
- **Request**: None (IP in URL)
- **Response**: JSON with status and message
- **Location**: `src/web/app.py` and `src/web/api.py`

## Frontend Components

### 1. Block Device Modal
- **Purpose**: Confirm device blocking action
- **Location**: `src/web/templates/index.html`
- **Features**: 
  - Shows device IP being blocked
  - Confirmation message
  - Cancel and Block buttons

### 2. Unblock Device Modal
- **Purpose**: Confirm device unblocking action
- **Location**: `src/web/templates/index.html`
- **Features**: 
  - Shows device IP being unblocked
  - Confirmation message
  - Cancel and Unblock buttons

### 3. Enhanced Device Cards
- **Purpose**: Display device status and actions
- **Location**: `src/web/templates/base.html`
- **Features**: 
  - Visual highlighting for blocked devices
  - "BLOCKED" badge for blocked devices
  - Dynamic action buttons (Block/Unblock based on status)

## Backend Integration

### DeviceManager Integration
- Both blocking and unblocking methods use the existing DeviceManager methods
- Added reachability checks before attempting to block/unblock
- Proper error handling and response formatting

### Device Status Tracking
- In a production implementation, device blocking status would be stored in the database
- For this implementation, status is determined at runtime

## Usage

### Blocking a Device
1. Navigate to the Network Management Tool web interface
2. Find the device you want to block in the device list
3. Click the red "Block" button on the device card
4. Confirm the blocking action in the modal
5. The device will be blocked and the UI will update to show its blocked status

### Unblocking a Device
1. Navigate to the Network Management Tool web interface
2. Find the blocked device in the device list (it will have a red border and "BLOCKED" badge)
3. Click the green "Unblock" button on the device card
4. Confirm the unblocking action in the modal
5. The device will be unblocked and the UI will update to show its normal status

## Error Handling

The web interface includes proper error handling:
- Network reachability checks before blocking/unblocking
- Clear error messages for failed operations
- Loading indicators during operations
- Success notifications for completed operations

## Security Considerations

- All blocking/unblocking operations are protected by the same authentication mechanisms as other device management functions
- Confirmation modals prevent accidental blocking/unblocking
- Reachability checks prevent attempts to block/unblock unreachable devices
