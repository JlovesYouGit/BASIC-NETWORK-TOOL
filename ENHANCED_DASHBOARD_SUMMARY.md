## Key Components

### EnhancedTerminalDashboard Class
The main class that implements all dashboard functionality:

```python
class EnhancedTerminalDashboard:
    def __init__(self, scanner, manager):
        # Initialize with scanner and manager instances
    
    def run(self):
        # Main dashboard loop with screen management
    
    def _show_main_dashboard(self):
        # Display main dashboard menu and navigation
    
    def _show_network_overview(self):
        # Display network statistics and activity charts
    
    def _show_device_discovery(self):
        # Device discovery interface with scanning options
    
    def _perform_scan(self, network_type):
        # Perform network scans with progress indicators
    
    def _show_device_details(self, device):
        # Detailed device information with port visualization
    
    def _show_performance_metrics(self):
        # Network performance charts and metrics
    
    def _show_device_management(self):
        # Device management interface
    
    def _manage_device(self, ip_address):
        # Device management with authentication
```

## Usage

### Running the Enhanced Dashboard
```bash
python network_tool.py --enhanced-dashboard
```

### Navigation
1. Use number keys to select options from menus
2. Press Enter to confirm selections
3. Type 'back' to return to previous menus
4. Press Ctrl+C to exit the dashboard

## Integration with Existing Components

### NetworkScanner Integration
- Uses existing scanning methods for device discovery
- Leverages fingerprinting capabilities for detailed device information
- Integrates progress indicators during scanning operations

### DeviceManager Integration
- Uses existing device management methods
- Supports both password and SSH key authentication
- Provides visual feedback during management operations

## Dependencies Added

The following dependencies were added to `requirements.txt`:
- `blessed>=1.21.0`
- `plotext>=5.3.2`

These libraries provide:
- Terminal handling and cross-platform support
- ASCII charting and visualization capabilities
- Enhanced text formatting and UI components

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_enhanced_dashboard.py`:
- Module import testing
- Class initialization testing
- Mock object integration testing

### Verification
