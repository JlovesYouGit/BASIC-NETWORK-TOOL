# Persistent Network Blocking Implementation

This document describes how to set up persistent network blocking that survives system reboots.

## Overview

The network blocking system now includes persistence features that ensure blocked IP addresses remain blocked even after system restarts. This is accomplished through:

1. Persistent storage of blocked IP addresses
2. Platform-specific startup mechanisms
3. Automatic restoration of blocking rules on system boot

## Implementation Details

### Persistent Storage

Blocked IP addresses are stored in a JSON file located at:
```
project/blocked_ips.json
```

This file is automatically created and updated whenever IP addresses are blocked or unblocked.

### Platform-Specific Persistence

#### Windows

On Windows systems, persistence is achieved through:
1. Firewall rules that are persistent by default
2. A startup batch script (`restore_blocked_ips.bat`) that re-applies rules on boot
3. (Optional) Windows service installation for automatic restoration

#### Linux

On Linux systems, persistence is achieved through:
1. Integration with `iptables-persistent` if available
2. Startup script in `/etc/network/if-up.d/` if `iptables-persistent` is not available
3. Automatic rule restoration on network interface up events

#### macOS

On macOS systems, persistence is achieved through:
1. Startup shell script (`restore_blocked_ips.sh`)
2. Launch daemon for automatic restoration on boot

## Setup Instructions

### Windows Setup

1. Run the network blocking commands as Administrator
2. Blocked IPs are automatically saved to `blocked_ips.json`
3. A startup batch script is created at `restore_blocked_ips.bat`
4. (Optional) Run `install_persistent_blocking.bat` as Administrator to install a Windows service

### Linux Setup

1. Run the network blocking commands as root
2. Blocked IPs are automatically saved to `blocked_ips.json`
3. If `iptables-persistent` is installed, rules are automatically saved
4. Otherwise, a startup script is created in `/etc/network/if-up.d/`

### macOS Setup

1. Run the network blocking commands with sudo
2. Blocked IPs are automatically saved to `blocked_ips.json`
3. A startup script is created at `restore_blocked_ips.sh`
4. Make the script executable: `chmod +x restore_blocked_ips.sh`
5. Add to startup items or create a launch daemon

## Automatic Restoration

The system automatically restores blocked IPs on startup through:

1. Loading the list of blocked IPs from `blocked_ips.json`
2. Re-applying firewall rules for each blocked IP
3. Logging restoration progress and any errors

## Testing Persistence

To test persistence:

1. Block an IP address using any interface (CLI, web, or terminal dashboard)
2. Verify the IP is blocked by checking firewall rules
3. Restart the system
4. Verify the IP is still blocked after restart
5. Check `blocked_ips.json` to confirm the IP is stored

## Files Created

- `blocked_ips.json` - Persistent storage of blocked IP addresses
- `restore_blocked_ips.py` - Script to restore blocked IPs on startup
- `restore_blocked_ips.bat` - Windows startup script (automatically created)
- `restore_blocked_ips.sh` - macOS startup script (automatically created)
- `install_persistent_blocking.bat` - Windows service installer
- `network-blocker.service` - Linux systemd service file
- `com.networkblocker.plist` - macOS launch daemon plist

## Security Considerations

1. **Administrator Privileges**: Blocking operations require administrator/root privileges
2. **File Permissions**: Persistent storage files should have appropriate permissions
3. **Startup Scripts**: Startup scripts should be secured against unauthorized modification
4. **Audit Logging**: All blocking operations are logged for audit purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Blocked IPs Not Restored

1. Check if `blocked_ips.json` exists and contains the expected IPs
2. Verify startup scripts have appropriate permissions
3. Check system logs for errors during startup
4. Manually run the restoration script to test

### Firewall Rules Not Applied

1. Verify firewall service is running
2. Check if required firewall commands are available
3. Ensure sufficient privileges to modify firewall rules
4. Review system logs for command execution errors

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the persistent blocking system:

1. Integration with cloud-based storage for cross-system synchronization
2. Web interface for managing persistent blocking rules
3. Scheduled rule expiration with automatic cleanup
4. Backup and restore functionality for blocking rule sets
5. Integration with network monitoring systems for automatic blocking
