# Network Access Control Implementation

This document describes the implementation of network access control features in the Network Management Tool, which allow you to block and unblock devices from accessing your network directly from the web interface.

## Overview

The network access control features provide a more effective way to deal with problematic devices by completely blocking their network access rather than just flagging them. This is accomplished through firewall rule management that prevents the devices from communicating on the network.

## Implementation Details

### DeviceManager Methods

Two new methods were implemented in the `DeviceManager` class:

1. `block_device_network_access(ip_address, network_gateway="192.168.1.1")`
   - Blocks a device's network access by simulating the addition of firewall rules
   - Includes reachability checks before attempting to block the device
   - Returns a boolean indicating success or failure

2. `unblock_device_network_access(ip_address, network_gateway="192.168.1.1")`
   - Unblocks a device's network access by simulating the removal of firewall rules
   - Includes reachability checks before attempting to unblock the device
   - Returns a boolean indicating success or failure

### Web Interface Integration

The web interface was enhanced with the following features:

1. **Block Device Access**
   - Device cards in the dashboard show a "Block" button for unblocked devices
   - Clicking "Block" opens a confirmation modal
   - Confirmed blocking sends a POST request to `/api/device/<ip>/block`

2. **Unblock Device Access**
   - Device cards for blocked devices show an "Unblock" button
   - Clicking "Unblock" opens a confirmation modal
   - Confirmed unblocking sends a POST request to `/api/device/<ip>/unblock`

3. **Visual Indicators**
   - Blocked devices are highlighted with a red border
   - A "BLOCKED" badge is displayed on blocked device cards
   - Device cards dynamically update to show the correct action button

### API Endpoints

Two new API endpoints were added:

1. `POST /api/device/<ip>/block` - Blocks a device's network access
2. `POST /api/device/<ip>/unblock` - Unblocks a device's network access

Both endpoints include proper error handling and validation.

## Usage

### From the Web Interface

1. Navigate to the Network Management Tool web interface at http://localhost:5000
2. Find the device you want to block/unblock in the device list
3. Click the appropriate "Block" or "Unblock" button on the device card
4. Confirm the action in the modal that appears
5. The device status will update automatically

### From the Command Line

```bash
# Block a device
python network_tool.py --block-device 192.168.1.100

# Unblock a device
python network_tool.py --unblock-device 192.168.1.100
```

## Security Considerations

- All blocking/unblocking operations include reachability checks to prevent unnecessary operations
- Confirmation modals prevent accidental blocking/unblocking
- Proper error handling and logging for all operations
- Clear feedback on the success or failure of operations

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the network access control features:
- Integration with actual firewall APIs (iptables, pfSense, etc.)
- Time-based blocking with automatic expiration
- Blocking based on MAC address in addition to IP
- Integration with network switches for port-based blocking
- Bulk blocking operations for multiple devices
- Blocking rule persistence across reboots
