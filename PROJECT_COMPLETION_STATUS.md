✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout
✅ **Modular Design**: Well-structured, maintainable codebase

## Dependencies Status

✅ **Scapy**: Working for network scanning
✅ **Paramiko**: Working for SSH-based device access
✅ **python-nmap**: Working for advanced device fingerprinting
✅ **Rich**: Working for interactive command-line interface
✅ **Nmap**: Installed in break folder and accessible via explicit path

## Nmap Integration

Nmap has been successfully integrated with fallback mechanisms:
- Primary: Uses python-nmap library
- Fallback: Explicit path to Nmap executable in break folder
- Backup: Basic scanning methods when Nmap is unavailable

## Usage

The tool is fully functional with the following commands:

```bash
# Show help
python run.py --help

# Scan local network
python run.py --scan local

# Scan server network
python run.py --scan server

# Scan web server
python run.py --scan web

# Manage a specific device
python run.py --manage 192.168.1.100

# Launch interactive dashboard
python run.py --dashboard
```

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure Nmap is accessible:
   - Run `setup_nmap.bat` to add Nmap to your PATH
   - Or use the built-in fallback to the break folder

## Testing

All implemented functionality has been thoroughly tested:
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ CLI interface functional
- ✅ Nmap integration working
- ✅ SSH key authentication functional
- ✅ Interactive dashboard working

## Documentation

Complete documentation is available:
- API Documentation for all modules
- User Manual with detailed instructions
- Configuration Guide for setup and customization
- Troubleshooting Guide for common issues

## Conclusion

The Network Management Tool project has been successfully completed with all features implemented, thoroughly tested, and properly documented. The tool provides comprehensive network scanning and device management capabilities with a focus on security and usability.

No further development work is required unless additional features are requested.
