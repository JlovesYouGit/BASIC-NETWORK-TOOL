- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ CLI interface functional
- ✅ Nmap integration working
- ✅ SSH key authentication functional
- ✅ Interactive dashboard working
- ✅ Server and web scanning functional

## Usage

The tool is fully functional with the following commands:

```bash
# Show help
python run.py --help

# Scan local network
python run.py --scan local

# Scan server network
python run.py --scan server

# Scan web server
python run.py --scan web

# Manage a specific device
python run.py --manage 192.168.1.100

# Launch interactive dashboard
python run.py --dashboard
```

## Dependencies Installation

To install all required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To ensure Nmap is accessible, run the setup script:

```bash
setup_nmap.bat
```

## Conclusion
